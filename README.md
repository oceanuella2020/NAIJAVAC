# NAIJAVAC
NAIJAVAC is a vacation web application that will target improving vacation experience in Nigeria. It will contain at least top 10 or 15 vacation centers in each 36 states in Nigeria with good accommodation facilities where people from far and near can come and spend their vacation. NAIJAVAC will also make a cost analysis of the selected vacation center, and also provide the user with the exchange rate as the targets are Africans and non-Africans who will find it easy to spend less in Nigeria and get more as most of the non-Nigerian currencies have a high exchange rate. NAIJAVAC will also consist of the kind of environment each of these places have and the kind of weather that should be expected over there through the year. For example, the obudu cattle ranch is like a game reserve with the natural environment and extraordinary weather conditions, while we have some that are located close to the beach and so on. The Web application will also have information about the cultural value of the people that live where the vacation center is located, their food, language, mode of dressing and so on. All these and many more are what the user will have access to in the corner of his/her room and be relieved of the stress of seeking the service of an expert in search of great vacation centers. The user will be assigned to a tour guide as they make their choice. Reservation, payment and other plans also begin immediately.
